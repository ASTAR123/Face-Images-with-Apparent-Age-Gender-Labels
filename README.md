# Face-Images-with-Apparent-Age-Gender-Labels

## Introduction  

Gender and age prediction is a challenging task in computer vision. It is difficult to accurately predict the gender and age of a person from a single image of their face due to factors such as makeup, lighting, obstructions, and facial expressions. However, there are a number of machine learning techniques that can be used to improve the accuracy of gender and age prediction.

In this project, we will explore four different machine learning techniques for gender and age prediction: eigen decomposition, singular value decomposition, linear regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We will use a publicly available dataset of facial images to train and evaluate our models.

Eigen decomposition is a matrix factorization technique that can be used to extract features from images. We will use eigen decomposition to extract features that are relevant to gender and age prediction.

Singular value decomposition is another matrix factorization technique that can be used to extract features from images. We will use singular value decomposition to extract features that are complementary to those extracted by eigen decomposition.

Linear regression is a simple but effective machine learning model that can be used for regression tasks such as gender and age prediction. We will use linear regression to predict the gender and age of a person from the features extracted by eigen decomposition and singular value decomposition.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are more complex machine learning models that can learn more complex patterns than linear regression models. We will use ANNs to predict the gender and age of a person from the features extracted by eigen decomposition, singular value decomposition, and linear regression.

We will compare the performance of the four different machine learning techniques on the publicly available dataset of facial images. We will also analyze the features that are extracted by each technique and discuss how these features contribute to gender and age prediction.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored four different machine learning techniques for gender and age prediction: eigen decomposition, singular value decomposition, linear regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We used a publicly available dataset of facial images to train and evaluate our models.

We find:

Using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for facial information processing offers the following advantages:

1.Dimensionality reduction: SVD can reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional facial image data to a lower dimension, reducing the number of features. This helps save storage space and computational costs, and can remove redundant information while extracting the most important features.

2.Denoising: SVD can remove noise from facial images by retaining higher singular values. Smaller singular values correspond to noise or less important details in the image, while larger singular values correspond to the main information. By keeping the feature vectors associated with larger singular values, denoising effects can be achieved.

3.Face recognition: SVD can be employed for face recognition tasks. By performing SVD decomposition on a set of facial images and retaining the relevant feature vectors, it becomes possible to extract the most discriminative facial features for recognition purposes.

4.Data compression: SVD can be utilized for compressing facial image data. By representing the image using a reduced number of significant singular values and their corresponding feature vectors, it is possible to achieve compression while maintaining the essential information necessary for facial analysis and recognition.


Possible reasons and conclusions for the linear regression model performing better than the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) in facial age and gender prediction:

1.Linear relationship in data features: Linear regression models are suitable for data with strong linear relationships. In facial age and gender prediction tasks, there may be some direct linear relationships between certain facial features and age or gender. Therefore, the linear regression model can better capture these relationships and obtain more accurate predictions.

2.Data size and model complexity: Linear regression models have lower complexity compared to neural network models. In cases where the data size is small, neural network models may overfit and result in decreased performance. Linear regression models are easier to train and generalize with limited data, thus they may perform better.

3.Feature selection and dimensionality: Linear regression models are typically used for a small number of input features and are sensitive to feature selection and importance. In facial age and gender prediction tasks, if appropriate facial features can be selected and properly preprocessed, the linear regression model can more accurately learn the relationships between these features and age/gender. On the other hand, neural network models may rely more on a large number of features and data, making them more challenging to train.

In conclusion, possible reasons for the linear regression model outperforming the ANN in facial age and gender prediction include the presence of linear relationships in data features, the impact of data size and model complexity, and the influence of feature selection and dimensionality. However, it is important to note that the choice of the most suitable model depends on the specific dataset and task requirements. In some cases, neural network models may still provide better performance and flexibility. Therefore, in practical applications, model selection and optimization should be based on the specific circumstances.
